# Weather-Play
WeatherPlay is an app that displays the weather data for a specified location provided by the user- current weather, hourly forecast (48 hours) and daily forecast (7 days).  The units (C/F) can be toggled between imperial and metric and the location can be changed by using the options-menu. The weather data is retrieved from the OpenWeather API. This has been done using Multiple Activities, Internet API, RecyclerViews, Option-Menus, Android Volley, JSON data, Time Conversion, Dialogs and Images in Android Studio.
